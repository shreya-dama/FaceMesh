Libraries used: Opencv and mediapipe



Input used: Face captured from the live camera. So a camera connected to system is required.

Algorithm used:
  Mediapipe in general is a pretrained library that has the ability to detect facial landmarks. So this ability is made use of in the program and green dots are placed wherever the landmarks are detected.
